# Midterm-Project
This is for the 1000 INFOTC Class

## This is the MidTerm Project
**Introduction:** My name is Claudia Fuentes but my full name goes as Claudia Y. S. Fuentes

## A little bit about me

**Personal Life:** 
> I live with my mom and dad and my little sister. I also have an older sister who is married and with a child. My family is actually really big if you count all of the relatives from the other states like:
* Texas
* Tennessee
* Virginia
* Maryland. 
Its also possible that there are more _unknown relatives_ as well because I only know some relatives from Texas and from Tennessee.

# Education
> Currently I am a freshman in the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu) but I am studying to earn a **Bachelors Degree** in Information Technology > with the pathway of Engineering.
